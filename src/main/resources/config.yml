# Use to define the levels of permissions

permissions:

  # Permission level names (Order does not matter)
  names:
    -operator
    -default

  # Permission level for each category
  #
  # Numeric level is for general permissions
  #
  # Tags are used for certain level to have higher level permissions
  # Example:
  #   -Build team cannot moderate, but can build
  #   -Moderators can moderate, but cannot build
  #   -Admins can do both
  #   Tags can allow build teams to build without disrupting a permission level chain
  levels:
    operator:
      level: -1
      tags: ""
    default:
      level: 0
      tags: ""

  #Sets the default permission level for anyone who joins
